# ML-WineClassification
**1. Introduction**
In this project, we will be developing Machine Learning models on the data set using classification techniques to determine which model yields the best outcome. We have selected a dataset related to wine quality and we will be applying classification techniques on this dataset. We will be comparing the outcomes of each model and evaluate what can be done to improve the accuracy of the model.

**2. Problem Statement**
Wine classification by quality is a difficult task as taste is very subjective. There are many components of wine with the main ones being water, alcohol, acid, sugar, and phenolic compounds. Through machine learning, we aim to find out if physicochemical features of wines affect the quality of wine. We will be able to derive quantitative and unbiased results using machine learning models. We will be using three types of supervised machine learning model namely Logistic Regression Model, K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), and Decision Tree. This information can be useful for research, marketing purposes or to improve the production and quality of wine.

**3. Data Set**
The Red wine data consists of 1,599 samples (1,599 rows and 12 columns) and distributed by UC Irvine on both their own website and Kaggle. The features taken for the data are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. Based on the features we are going to predict the quality of the wine. For predicting the wine quality, we will be building classifiers based on supervised Machine Learning.
